# üîç hypotheses

\[Draft]

(Hypothesis 1)

**The Arabic language is a constructed language Intro:**

This hypothesis posits that the Arabic language is a product of intentional human design, with the aim of minimizing potential semantic changes over time. It posits that Quranic Arabic features a structure that enables the deduction of language rules from the designed patterns.

The awareness of semantic change as a phenomenon in language has likely existed for as long as people have been observing and using language‚Äîa history spanning thousands of years. The Quran contains multiple verses (2:75, 4:46, 5:13, 5:41, 41:26) that highlight incidents where people distorted the meanings of words, underscoring the authors' knowledge of this linguistic phenomenon. One possible outcome of the existence of awareness of such a phenomenon is the emergence of individuals who seek solutions to preserve the knowledge they acquire for future generations. While the structure of Semitic languages, with their root system, could contribute to this goal, it may not be sufficient. Despite having this structure, Semitic languages are still classified as natural languages. However, the Arabic language potentially exhibits patterns in its structure that could further support the argument for its designed nature.

An interesting pattern in the Arabic language used in the Quranic text is the existence of a fair number of antigrams. These are words that, when their letters are rearranged, form antonyms or words with opposite meanings. The antigrams contained within the Arabic language are even more specific because the rearrangement of letters is not random; rather, it involves reversing some or all of the word's letters. This could potentially suggest a logical relationship between the letters and their order that helps specify the term's meaning. If found in large quantities, this intriguing pattern cannot be the product of chance or randomness but rather the result of deliberate design. The ‚Å†antigrams page will be used for an in-depth study of this pattern to determine its relevance and how strong of evidence it provides, potentially proving the hypothesis that Arabic is a constructed language.
